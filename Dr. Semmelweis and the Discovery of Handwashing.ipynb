If Dr. Semmelweis looks troubled it's probably because he's thinking about <em>childbed fever</em>: A deadly disease affecting women that just have given birth. He is thinking about it because in the early 1840s at the Vienna General Hospital as many as 10% of the women giving birth die from it. He is thinking about it because he knows the cause of childbed fever: It's the contaminated hands of the doctors delivering the babies. And they won't listen to him and <em>wash their hands</em>!</p>\n","<p>In this notebook, we're going to reanalyze the data that made Semmelweis discover the importance of <em>handwashing</em>.
